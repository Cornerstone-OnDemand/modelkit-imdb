This sample project aims at illustrating modelkit's powerful features, based on the documentation tutorial: [NLP x Sentiment Analysis](https://clustree.github.io/modelkit/examples/nlp_sentiment/intro.html).

It also serves as a sandbox for any developer willing to try out modelkit in _real conditions_, from the package organization to the Github CI and through the use of CLIs and HTTP serving.

## TL;DR

You can skip these different sections, and jump to the result hosted on `Heroku` at https://modelkit-imdb.herokuapp.com/docs/.

## Installation

First, please `source .env` or run the following:

```bash
export MODELKIT_ASSETS_DIR=.local_storage
export MODELKIT_STORAGE_BUCKET=.
export MODELKIT_STORAGE_PREFIX=.remote_storage
export MODELKIT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local
export MODELKIT_DEFAULT_PACKAGE=modelkit_imdb  # shortcut for CLIs
```

Once done, let's create a new python virtual environment and install the dev requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Describe CLI

Before going further, let's remind us of the models that are available in the `modelkit_imdb` package with the following CLI:

```
modelkit describe
```

<img src=".github/resources/describe.gif" style="margin: 20px" />


## Run tests

Also, let's make sure everything works as intended by running some tests.
```
pytest
```

As you can see in the `tests/`subfolder, two things were added:
- in `conftest.py`: a pytest fixture `model_library` which creates a `ModelLibrary` with all the models found in the package
```
from modelkit.testing.fixtures import modellibrary_fixture

modellibrary_fixture(
    models=modelkit_imdb,
    fixture_name="model_library",
)
```
- in `test_auto_testing.py`: a test which iterates through all `modelkit_imdb` models to find tests and run them, using the just-defined `model_library` fixture:
```python
from modelkit.testing import modellibrary_auto_test

modellibrary_auto_test(
    models=modelkit_imdb,
    fixture_name="model_library"
)
```

For more info, head over to [Testing](https://clustree.github.io/modelkit/library/models/testing.html).

## Local HTTP serving

The following CLI will start a single worker which will expose all the models found under the `modelkit_imdb` package leveraging [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/):

```
modelkit serve
```

Voil√†: the [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) worker is now running at `http://localhost:8000`.

Modelkit also offers out-of-the-box support for [gunicorn](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/):
```bash
gunicorn --workers 4 \
         --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \
         --preload \
         --worker-class=uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker \
         'modelkit.api:create_modelkit_app()'
```

Check out the generated `SwaggerUI` at http://localhost:8000/docs to see all the endpoints and try them out:

<img src=".github/resources/swagger.gif" alt="modelkit swagger" style="margin: 20px">

You can also `POST` your request on the endpoint of your choice:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/predict/imdb_classifier' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "text": "This movie sucks! It is the worst I have ever seen in my entire life"
}'
# {"label":"bad","score": 0.1530771553516388}
```

## Deployment example

To conclude this sample project, a minimal `Dockerfile` was written as well as a `heroku.yml` file so that to host our different models on `Heroku` at https://modelkit-imdb.herokuapp.com/docs/.

You can run it locally using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and enjoy the Swagger at: http://localhost:8000/docs:

```
docker build -t modelkit-imdb .                                                                                                                                                                             16:51:07 
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e PORT=8000 modelkit-imdb 
```
